# Hmm...

## about this project...

I seem to be using this project as a vehicle to experiment with some different web technologies.
Next.js, MDX, Styled Components/System, etc.

## Is it a blog, or is it a vehicle for exploration?

I'm thinking it is the latter, but I have mixed feelings (like always).

- web technology: moves fast, "flavor of the week" libraries/frameworks/paradigms
- blogs: aggregate thoughts over time.

It seems like making a blog with "hot new" tech is asking for friction down the line.
While there may be some nice ergonomics introduced by things like MDX, Next, Styled System, etc,
these technologies can be a bit opinionated. There is this element of being "locked in".

To maintain a blog, it seems like you have to set yourself up to stay interested in publishing.
Will I still be interested in two years from now when Next/MDX/etc go "out of fashion?"

One aspect of my setup that bothers me currently is the MDX aspect.
While it allows me to add some cool, more "dynamic", elements to my posts, I do wonder how it "pollutes" the content.
If I want to migrate to a different rendering platform later, will the MDX elements get in the way of a "clean" migration?
Markdown is nice because it is a standard. Introducing non-standard custom elements, while useful, complicates re-use in a different context.

## Shoutout to the content strategists out there

(And shoutout to all the devs aiming to "solve" blogging and content management with some fancy tools and elbow grease.)
