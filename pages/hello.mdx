# Hello

hi there. this is markdown being loaded/rendered/served by next.js via mdx

# MDX is interesting

I wonder if there is a way for this to get passed any props from Next...
maybe a custom wrapper that passes props to children?
still wrapping my head around exactly what is going on here.

<Box color="primary" bg="secondary" p="2">
  this is a styled component within a markdown/mdx file
</Box>

<Meme>jsx inside of markdown?</Meme>

> mdx

# cool
